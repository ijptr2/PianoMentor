Goal: Build the first prototype of an AI-powered, dual-device piano learning system. The phone acts as a playable piano keyboard, and the laptop shows lessons, feedback, and progress. Devices are synced via Firebase in real-time. AI adjusts learning paths based on user strengths and weaknesses.

Features to Implement:
1. Dual Device Experience
Phone App (Flutter App)

Full-screen playable piano keyboard with multi-touch support.

Sound for each key press (use MIDI sounds or Flutter packages like flutter_midi_command).

Real-time note data sent to Firebase with timestamps.

UI design is responsive — no small keys, each key sized properly across screen width.

Laptop App (Web App using Flutter Web)

Real-time display of which notes are being played on the phone (sync from Firebase).

Shows AI-generated practice suggestions and lesson progress.

Option to review previous practice sessions.

2. Firebase Integration
Use Firebase Realtime Database or Cloud Firestore to:

Store notes being played (live data stream).

Track user history and session metrics (note accuracy, timing).

Store AI-generated lesson plans or practice goals.

3. AI-Based Personalized Learning
On the backend (Node.js or Python — use Replit’s Flask template if using Python):

Basic rule-based system to evaluate timing accuracy, chord recognition, and suggest what to practice next.

Detects if user struggles with certain scales or rhythm.

Sends updated practice suggestions to Firebase for the laptop app to display.

4. Freestyle Mode
On phone: User can play freely.

On backend: System detects scale/key and gives name/feedback (e.g. “You’re playing in A Minor”).

On laptop: Display current scale, chord suggestions, and improv tips.

5. UI/UX Details
Phone UI:

Full keyboard with 14–16 white keys visible at once.

Sustain option, volume slider, toggle for practice vs freestyle mode.

Laptop UI:

Left Panel: Daily goal, practice log.

Center: Real-time note viewer.

Right Panel: AI tips (“Try practicing G major scale,” “Smooth your transitions”).

Clean, piano-like color scheme (black/white/gold or soft blue tones).

Tools/Packages to Use on Replit
Flutter: Use Flutter Web and Flutter Mobile support (can test mobile using Android emulator or iOS device).

Firebase: Firebase Core, Firebase Auth, Cloud Firestore.

Audio & Piano UI: flutter_midi, flutter_sound, or custom widget piano packages.

Backend AI (Optional for now):

Flask (Python) or Node.js server

Uses logic to parse note sequences and suggest learning paths

Can host ML models later using TensorFlow Lite
